## 💡 Quick Tips

### Working with Seeded Data
```typescript
// Fetch all properties
const properties = await prisma.property.findMany({
  include: { host: true }
});

// Fetch featured properties (for landing page)
const featured = await prisma.property.findMany({
  where: { featured: true },
  take: 4
});

// Fetch by property type
const rentals = await prisma.property.findMany({
  where: { propertyType: 'RENT' }
});
```

### Unsplash Image URLs
All images follow this pattern:
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{id}?w=1200&h=800&fit=crop&q=80
```
- `w=1200&h=800` - Optimized size
- `fit=crop` - Cropped to aspect ratio
- `q=80` - 80% quality (good balance)

### Re-seeding Database
```bash
# Clear and re-seed
npm run db:seed
```
